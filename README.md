# Capstone_Project_2 - Diabetes Dataset Visualizations in Tableau

This part of the Capstone 2 Project utilizes tableau to tackle specific questions per the dataset youâ€™ve chosen.

This Tableau task lets you be creative with the way you build your dashboard and only gives guidance on the types of visualisations you should use.

Create a dashboard that will contain at least 5 out of the 7 requirements defined below:

At least 2 KPIs as Big Ass Numbers. Choose the metrics on your own that will fit with the rest of your analysis. Examples of metrics:
% of diabetic patients out of all patients
% of smokers out of all diabetic patients 
etc.
A Bar Chart, for example, comparing one or more patient characteristics and the corresponding amount of diabetic and non-diabetic patients. 
A Bar Chart using Quick Table Calculation, for example, for each combination of patient characteristics comparing the % of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
A Highlight Table (Heatmap), for example, between education and income level, where each cell corresponds to % of Total patients in each combination. By building two such heatmaps you can compare diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
A Pareto Analysis based on a custom-defined patient segment to answer a question: Which patient segments make up 80% out of all patients with diabetes? 
Segment can include values from the demographic and/or health information of the client. For example, 
Education | Income | Smoker | Alcohol Consumption
Age | Physical Activity | BMI
etc.
At least 1 parameter that allows dashboard user to interact with the dashboard. For example,
to change the health measure you are looking at at your graph
to change the metric from relative to absolute
to choose multiple parameter values based on user own characteristics and see the risk of having diabetes with such values (but can also be done with filters depending on the approach)
At least one more visualization of your choice adds value to your analysis
